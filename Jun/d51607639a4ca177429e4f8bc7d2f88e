5 June 2009Media briefings scheduled for 8 to 15 June 2009 have been postponed until further notice.This is to allow the newly-constituted Administration to familiarise themselves with the programmes of their respective departments and clusters of Government.Ministers are also preparing for their Budget Votes, which will be presented shortly in Parliament.A new schedule for the briefings will be announced shortly to give Ministers the opportunity as promised by the President in the State of the Nation Address to publicly share details of Government s Programme of Action.GCIS regrets the inconvenience.Enquiries: Harold Maloka: 082 847 9799 Colin Cruywagen: 082 377 9916Issued by: Government Communications (GCIS)
